- **‚ú® New Attribute - `aria`** - [SaraVieira]

    [`aria` attributes] are critical to making the web more accessible to
    everyone, but most importantly, people with disabilities. These were a to-do
    item from the original project, and so we to-did them. At least most of
    them. There are a [few open issues] if you'd like to help us complete the
    implementation.

- **‚ú® New Attribute - `meta:property`** - [SaraVieira]

    If you ask the internet why `meta` tags have a `property` attribute that 
    isn't in the spec, you won't get great answers. Although not formally
    specified in HTML5, `property` attributes in `meta` tags are important for
    SEO and [the Open Graph Protocol]. They *are* documented in [RDFa] which is
    a formal W3C recommendation.

    It is outside the scope of this project to standardize standards bodies. We
    needed to support the `property` attribute, and so we did.
