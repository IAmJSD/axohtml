### üõ†Ô∏è Fixes

- **‚ú® Data Attributes now work with more than one hyphen - [SaraVieira], [pr10]**

  Our support for `data` attributes was limited in the way that it only supported one hyphen in said attributes, well, no more, use as many hyphens as your heart pleases

- **‚ú® Allow `script` tags in HTML - [SaraVieira], [pr10]**

  We now allow you to add script tags in the HTML after the body as the HTML standards also allow

- **‚ú® Allow unescaped text in`script`- [SaraVieira], [pr14]**

  Until now we were escaping the text passed down to the `script` tag and in the `script` tag is the only place we are sure we don't want to escape that so that's fixed and you can add `script` tags with unescaped text inside

## 0.2.0 - 2022-12-19

### üéÅ Features

- **‚ú® New Attribute - `aria`** - [SaraVieira]

  [`aria` attributes] are critical to making the web more accessible to
  everyone, but most importantly, people with disabilities. These were a to-do
  item from the original project, and so we to-did them. At least most of
  them. There are a [few open issues] if you'd like to help us complete the
  implementation.

- **‚ú® New Attribute - `meta:property`** - [SaraVieira]

  If you ask the internet why `meta` tags have a `property` attribute that
  isn't in the spec, you won't get great answers. Although not formally
  specified in HTML5, `property` attributes in `meta` tags are important for
  SEO and [the Open Graph Protocol]. They _are_ documented in [RDFa] which is
  a formal W3C recommendation.

  It is outside the scope of this project to standardize standards bodies. We
  needed to support the `property` attribute, and so we did.
